By Wade Smith, MD, as told to Kara Mayer Robinson. A diagnosis of HER2 positive breast cancer can be frightening at first, especially when you hear the words "aggressive cancer." But there is reason to be optimistic about todays advances in treatment. There is not a one size fits all approach, but with the help of your doctors, you can choose what is best for you.

Your Treatment Is Unique
HER2 positive breast cancer is different from other breast cancer types, so your treatment will not necessarily be the same as someone else who has a different form of breast cancer. It may also be different than another HER2 positive patients therapy. Each cancer is unique, so doctors try to develop the treatment course that is best for you. Things to consider include the size of your tumor, whether the cancer has metastasized (spread), or your overall risk of recurrence.

Treatments You May Consider
The most common treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer is chemotherapy plus HER2 directed therapy. This is followed by surgery, then continues with HER2 directed therapy. This is often best for patients with large tumors or cancer in regional lymph nodes.

For targeted therapy, your doctor may recommend a family of drugs commonly known as monoclonal antibodies. This includes trastuzumab (Herceptin), the first in its class precision therapy drug approved by the FDA for HER2 positive breast cancer.

It is less common, but you may have surgery first, followed by chemotherapy and HER2 directed therapy. Your doctor may choose this sequence if you have a small tumor that is not in your lymph nodes.

Your doctor may also recommend endocrine therapy. This treatment involves taking a daily pill for at least 5 years after you complete chemotherapy and surgery.
